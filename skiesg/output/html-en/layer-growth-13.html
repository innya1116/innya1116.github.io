        <p>To promptly alleviate environmental problems, such as climate change and plastic pollution, both government-level and corporate-level endeavors play a pivotal role. SK innovation has been undertaking such roles actively by fostering green start-ups and supporting the green ecosystems since 2019. Transition to a green, low-carbon society can be accelerated when start-ups with various innovative solutions grow and expand their businesses.</p>
        <p>Based on this belief, SK innovation has implemented the <b>Environment and Social Business Contest</b> and <b>SV<sup>2</sup> Impact Partnering</b> in 2019,  which eventually developed into a collaborative project with the Ministry of SMEs and Start-ups. "EGG" is the first Green Alliance in Korea which involved a collaboration between government agencies, conglomerates and external stakeholders such as impact funds to discover partnerships to foster green start-up companies.</p>
        <p>To accomplish the key task of "enhancing green ecosystem and green start-up partnerships", we will establish multiple new alliance to discover and foster green start-ups globally and establish stable, long-term projects pertinent to the "EGG" program. This project is expected to deliver a wide range of environmental, social and economic values as well as accelerate a transformation of the current economic structure into a one driven by medium-sized and venture companies, contributing to quality jobs and more equitable business ecosystems.</p>
