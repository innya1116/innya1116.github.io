      <div class="popup-contents">
        <p>SK innovation has established a Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) target of 0.062 at domestic business sites by 2025. SK innovation intends to take fundamental safety measures against risk factors by actively improving facilities, such as replacing facilities and installing safety devices based on the SHE management system for achieving global-standard management in safety, health and environment. In addition, by raising the awareness of employees about human-injury accidents, we intend to dramatically improve not only major accidents but also minor and near-miss accidents caused by individuals' negligence or lack of concentration.</p><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정 -->
        <p>For successfully achieving the LTIR goal, frequent human-injury accidents in the business sites shall be defined, and the appropriate reduction activities for each accident shall be carried out. According to the survey results of the previous year, as frequent human-injury accidents, Ulsan CLX has defined falls, burns, and traps, and SK on and SK ie technology has defined traps. We have launched a task force (TF) for each accident, intensively promoting appropriate improvement activities. At the same time, we will continuously discover and promote SHE tasks such as conducting in-depth risk assessments, improving unsafe facilities, and enacting rules for improving living safety at work.</p><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정 -->
        <p>We, along with tasks for establishing a safety culture such as "positive safety dialogue program" and "safety campaign in daily life," established various activities such as "vitalization of near-miss operation" and "reinforcement of risk prediction training" as tasks for reducing safety accidents, operating so as to contribute to the achievement of our LTIR goal.</p>
