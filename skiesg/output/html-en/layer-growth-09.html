        <p>SK innovation selects "Zero anti-corruption risk" as a core GROWTH task to comply with regulatory tightening related to anti-corruption and anti-bribery across the globe and prevent damage to corporate reputation and social/economic loss caused by ethical controversies. Practicing anti-corruption compliance management is the most fundamental element that global business partners and investors require for business operation in terms of transparent management. In addition, it is a pivotal element for the company to fulfill its social responsibilities as a member of civil society and maintain transparent business relations with partners.</p><!-- 220727 --><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정 -->
        <p>By 2025, SK innovation will establish a global-level anti-corruption management system and implement anti-corruption activities based on the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) virtuous cycle to control corruption incentives and eradicate corruption. To this end, we will regularly promulgate the management’s commitment and promise to practice anti-corruption and compliance management and zero tolerance of corruption by using media such as enterprise-wide notices and in-house broadcasting. At the same time, we push forward with compliance pledges of employees to enhance the corporate-wide momentum. In addition, for promptly recognizing the elements of illegal acts and promoting self-correction activities, we proceed to refine the reporting channels for employees and stakeholders on corrupt practices to be more accessible and establish various procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of reports and protecting the whistleblowers.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>One of the essential elements for fostering an anti-corruption compliance culture and realizing its internalization is the training of employees. The training informs the contents of the various anti-corruption compliance programs operated by the company and the company's efforts to practice them, and clearly guides the Do and Don'ts stipulated in the pertinent laws and company regulations, thereby serving as a guideline practicing anti-corruption and compliance management. Through continuous development of training content and research on effective training delivery methods, SK innovation will strive to achieve a 100% anti-corruption education completion rate for all employees.</p><!-- 220727 -->
