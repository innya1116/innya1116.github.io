        <p>To prevent any direct or indirect human rights violations in all business value chains, SK innovation has enacted SHE policy, conduct codes for partners, code of ethics for purchase, etc., and strictly complied with them in its management activities. The company has established and operated an organization and counseling support center in charge of managing the work environment at each business site to accomplish human rights management within the business sites in Korea. It conducts regular due diligence on human rights annually in accordance with the global guideline to identify vulnerable points and vulnerable social groups in advance and establish and execute an improvement plan.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>SK innovation pushes forward with the declaration on human rights management of respective overseas business sites to accomplish a goal of the core task. Furthermore, the company aims to develop and execute human rights policies appropriate for the characteristics of each business site. The company will conduct human rights due diligence on overseas business sites on a regular basis, and in accordance with the global "<b>Social Story</b>" which aims to take preventive measures against human rights violations occurring in overseas business sites. The human rights due diligence will be conducted in order by setting overseas business sites confirmed to have shortcomings in human rights management as priorities. For SK innovation to conduct more efficient human rights due diligence, the human rights survey will be developed for each region and country and up to global standards by considering the business characteristics of SK innovation that currently operates in various countries, such as the US, China, and those in Europe.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>To elevate the human rights management level of overseas business sites up to that of the domestic sites, in 2022, SK innovation has set "human rights protection" as its core GROWTH task. We will establish a monitoring system for the human rights management and a human rights policy for all our global sites.</p><!-- 220727 -->
