        <p>SK innovation is committed to developing an excellent organizational culture that promotes diversity and inclusion. We are creating new employment for the disabled by operating standard business sites for persons with disabilities, and we are continuously improving the working environment of employees with disabilities. To establish a female-friendly organizational culture, we are eradicating unfair practices that female talents may experience, expanding the recruitment of women, and actively supporting the development of female talents' capabilities.</p>
        <p>Recently, the importance of establishing and implementing strategies to respect and embrace the diversity of its employees not only in Korea but also all over the world has been reinforced as SK innovation's overseas business has grown rapidly. SK innovation intends to strengthen its willingness to internalize a culture of diversity and inclusion in overseas business sites as well as in Korea through the establishment of this GROWTH core task. Through active efforts such as establishing global-level diversity and inclusion policies and developing and implementing related training programs, we will support all employees at home and abroad to naturally adapt to the work environment with diverse employees.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>Through the core GROWTH task, SK innovation aims to build a company-wide management system which enhances workforce diversity and inclusion. The company will establish and execute policies for diversity and inclusion that meet global standards and expectations. It will regularly monitor factors related to wage fairness, such as promotion and performance evaluation, so that employees are not discriminated against due to characteristics other than their job competencies. Furthermore, with the help of the newly adopted D&amp;I indices as a key tool, SK innovation will strive to become a leading corporation in diversity and inclusion corporate culture.</p><!-- 220727 --><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정-->
