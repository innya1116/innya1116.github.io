        <p>SK innovation is promoting "Net Zero Operations" with the goal to achieve Scope 1 and 2 Net Zero in the hydrocarbon business by 2050 and Scope 1 and 2 Net Zero in the green business by 2035. To this end, we have established a mid-term carbon emission reduction target by dualizing existing businesses and new businesses with rapid growth. Specifically, by 2025, based on the absolute quantity, we aim to achieve a 25% reduction compared to 2019 baseline in the hydrocarbon business, and a 42% reduction in the green business compared to BAU.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>For the purpose of achieving the hydrocarbon business goal, we plan to implement fuel conversion, introduction of low-carbon raw materials, optimization of facilities and process operations, and acceleration of CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage) technology development. We will proceed with the efforts such as fuel conversion and process efficiency improvement to achieve the battery and materials business goals, planning to reduce carbon through the early accomplishment of RE100. At the same time, SK innovation will proceed to achieve the goal of the Net Zero Roadmap by purchasing carbon credits in both domestic and overseas markets based on the international carbon market mechanism.</p><!-- 220727 --><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정 -->
