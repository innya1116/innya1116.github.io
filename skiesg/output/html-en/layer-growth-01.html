        <p>SK innovation has established the "Carbon to Green" strategy for achieving the green portfolio-oriented innovation that contributes to global carbon reduction, revitalization of the circular economy, and sustainable supply of green energy, and establishing an identity called a "Green Energy &amp; Materials Co."</p>
        <p></p>The Carbon to Green strategy has a plan to promote based on the execution strategies divided into "Green Anchoring," and "Green Transformation". Taking the electric vehicle battery as an "Anchor," we are promoting the expansion of green businesses such as lithium-ion battery separator (LiBS), battery materials, used battery recycling (Battery Metal Recycling, BMR), and striving to realize a circular economy by expanding the production of carbon-reducing products and activating waste recycling, in existing business areas. At the same time, we will discover new business areas such as green energy supply and promote related investments, also continuing to make minimum essential investments to maintain competitiveness in the Hydrocarbon business.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>In order to promote the execution of the "Carbon to Green" strategy, the expansion of the green portfolio has been selected as a core GROWTH task. Through this core task, SK innovation plans to increase the proportion of green assets to twice that of the existing Hydrocarbon assets by 2025.</p>
