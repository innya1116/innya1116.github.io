        <p>SK Group’s management philosophy is rooted in the belief that the happiness of its employees and of economic and social value creation of the company are linked in a virtuous cycle. Happy employees come to engage in Voluntary & Willing Brain Engagement (VWBE), and by pursuing the Super Excellent Level (SUPEX) that the VWBE-employee can reach with human ability, it is the theory that the company becomes a sustainable SUPEX company.</p><!-- 220727 --><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정-->
        <p>SK innovation has implemented various happiness-seeking activities since 2019 to promote the happiness of its employees, confirming the will of our employees to actively participate in the pursuit of happiness. In 2021, "enhancing employee happiness" was established as a core task, and based on this, we plan to strengthen our efforts to enhance the happiness level of our employees.</p><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>To achieve this goal, the company plans to measure employees' happiness levels more frequently, which has been carried out once a year, to regularly monitor employees' happiness levels and make swift responses. In addition, it displays employees' happiness figures on the large media screen in the company building to instill happiness management culture to them and enhance their will to participate in the company's goal of pursuing happiness.</p><!-- 220727 -->
