        <p>To achieve the "Carbon to Green" strategy, the convergence of technological capabilities that SK innovation has accumulated so far and new capabilities is essential. The existing accumulated capabilities can be the basis for developing a new portfolio, but it is also necessary to introduce new capabilities and internalize them because existing capabilities cannot cover all the elements necessary for successful portfolio development.</p><!-- 220726 텍스트 수정 --><!-- 220727 -->
        <p>For securing and internalizing new capabilities, SK innovation is promoting technology verification and acquisition through cooperation with numerous universities, institutions, and companies all over the world, preparing to establish worldwide bases to strengthen open innovation and enhance execution. As part of these efforts, SK innovation intends to establish "Green Techno Campus" (tentative name) in the metropolitan area jointly with SK group subsidiaries, planning to create opportunities to discover promising technologies by establishing and expanding the global base centered in Silicon Valley, the United States, for strengthening open innovation in the future.</p><!-- 220727 텍스트 수정 --><!-- 220727 --><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정 -->
        <p>SK innovation will proceed to expand its portfolio by exploring new green business opportunities based on technology in consideration of market trends such as changes in the global energy mix.</p>
