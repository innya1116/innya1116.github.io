        <p>SK innovation seeks management for its employees and actively supports employees' growth and happiness. To this end, we have been operating the Harmonia Counseling Coaching Center, and have placed professional psychological counselors at the head office and business sites across the country while closely working with external experts in each field. As a personal counseling and coaching program for employees, we provide not only professional psychological counseling on work stress and interpersonal relationships but also customized coaching services for supporting new employees' early settlement and career development.</p>
        <p>Currently, SK innovation is in the process of operating a mental health-care program for global employees. We plan to develop programs according to regulations and culture in each country and provide psychological support for personal work stress and conflicts with other employees by partnership with external professional companies. In addition, we plan to gradually expand programs for employee well-being, such as using sick leaves due to mental illness and stress.</p><!-- 220727 텍스트 수정 --><!-- 220803 텍스트 수정 -->
        <p>In the future, based on the usage result of various mental health programs operated by SK innovation, we will manage the mental health index and analyze related potential risks. For the healthy development of not only individual employees but also the entire organization, we intend to create a healthy organizational culture of mutual respect by conducting preemptive prevention campaigns, training for each business site, and counseling for grievances.</p>
