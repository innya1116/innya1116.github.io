        <p>There is a growing regulatory focus on companies to attend to the adverse impacts of their supply chains on ESG issues, including the environmental and human rights issues. SK innovation has set ‘maintaining a sustainable supply chain and stable procurement’ and ‘supplier ESG risk management’ as the ultimate goals of our GROWTH ambitions. To accomplish these goals, we will identify high-risk suppliers and actively minimize potential ESG risks, fostering business partners with outstanding ESG practices and implementing sustainability-related programs.</p>
        <p>In 2022, we will provide comprehensive ESG training and consulting programs tailored to the respective ESG risks and issues pertaining to our suppliers, based on the assessment results from 2021. Simultaneously, we will gradually expand the scope of our due diligence programs for high-risk business partners and offer programs and rewards in order to enhance ESG management levels throughout our supply chain.</p>
        <p>Additionally, SK innovation will take ESG Factors into consideration to improve our bidding and transaction processes. Our GROWTH strategy and the following performance on supplier management will be consistently communicated with stakeholders.</p>
