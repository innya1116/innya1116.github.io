                <p>Samsung Electronics collects your personal information in a variety of ways. Below we describe the types of information we collect, which may include personal information.</p>
                <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
                <p>Some Services enable you to give us information directly. For example:</p>
                <ul class="dot-list">
                  <li>When you create an account or profile with us, we may ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or email address.</li>
                  <li>If you order a product or paid service from us, we may ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information to process your order.</li>
                  <li>To provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we may need information to verify your identity and the product you’re inquiring about.</li>
                  <li>When you communicate with our Customer Service staff or others, your communications will be transmitted through our systems.</li>
                  <li>If you share your contacts, we’ll collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in Settings on your devices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Information About Your Use of Services</h3>
                <p>In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information about your use of our Services through software on your devices and by other means. This information may include:</p>
                <ul class="dot-list">
                  <li>Device information: Your hardware model, device hardware information, IMEI number and other unique device identifiers, phone number, serial number, sales code, access recording, current software version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), MAC address, IP address, cookies, pixels, subscription information, operating system versions, and settings of the devices you use to access Services.</li>
                  <li>Log information: Diagnostic, technical, error, and usage information such as the time and duration of your use of Services, search query terms when you enter search terms into your device in connection with a particular Samsung Service, and any information stored in cookies that we have set on your devices.</li>
                  <li>Location information: Your device’s GPS signal or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services and enable the Location function.</li>
                  <li>Voice information: Recordings of your voice that we make and store on our servers when you enable this function and use voice commands to control a Service, or when you contact our Customer Service team. Note that if we work with a third party service provider that provides speech-to-text conversion services on our behalf, this provider may receive and store certain voice commands in accordance with the contract concluded between us and our trusted third-party service provider.</li>
                  <li>Samsung Keyboard information: The words that you type when you enable Predictive text. This feature may be offered in connection with your Samsung account to synchronize the data for use on your other Samsung mobile devices. You can clear the data by going to the Predictive text settings.</li>
                  <li>Viewing Information: The networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your devices and the amount of time spent viewing them.</li>
                  <li>Other information about your use of Services, such as the apps you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content offered through a Service.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Publicly or Commercially Available or Shared Information</h3>
                <p>We sometimes gather publicly or commercially available information, including information from social networks you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences. We also sometimes gather information about you when other people provide it using our Services, such as your name and contact information when others send a message to you or share files with you.</p>

                <h3>Other Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We may also collect other information about you, your devices, or your use of Services that you consent to send us. We obtain your consent in accordance with applicable law.</p>

                <h3>Third Party Analytics</h3>
                <p>Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyze your use of the Services and improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a> and <a href="http://https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.</p>
                <h3>Your Options</h3>
                <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of registering a Samsung account. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Services. We’ll do our best to explain these limitations when we’re asking for your information so you can make an informed decision. For example, Samsung Cloud allows you to back up your information and create a restore point; however, Samsung Cloud was not designed nor intended to store or process sensitive information.</p>

                  <li>(iii) To comply with applicable law and legal processes</li>
                  <li>(iv) With your consent (for example, to send direct marketing communications, process your personal information to send you interest-based advertising, provide you TV content recommendations, or for other purposes). If you give consent, you may withdraw it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing before its withdrawal. Where we obtain your consent, we explain how you can withdraw it in a manner as easy as giving consent. You can also revoke your consent by contacting us as specified in the <a href="#contact-us">CONTACT US</a> section of this Privacy Policy.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-panel" aria-hidden="true">
              <div class="privacy-policy__contents">
                <p>Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.</p>
                <p>The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.<br>In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. Below, we provide information about additional services and features available on the Smart TV, namely: Viewing Information Services, Interest-Based Advertisements, and Voice Recognition. Further below, you will find the privacy notices related to each of these.</p>
                <h3>Viewing Information Services</h3>
                <p>In order to provide you with customized content on your Smart TV and highlight programming that is likely to interest you, Samsung may rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information to provide Viewing Information Services. This is an optional service that you may choose to activate to receive content and recommendations that are customized to your interests and entertainment preferences. If you choose not to activate this service, or to subsequently deactivate it, then you will receive generic content that is not customized to your specific interests or preferences and is based on your Smart TV usage information only. Smart TV usage information includes information about frequently launched apps, and the start and end time for launching and using apps.<br>If you have activated Viewing Information Services, we base content and programming recommendations and additional services on:</p>
                <ul class="dot-list">
                  <li>Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices;</li>
                  <li>Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;</li>
                  <li>Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;</li>
                  <li>The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;</li>
                  <li>Other Smart TV device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.<br>For more detailed information about the Viewing Information Services, please refer to the Viewing Information Services Privacy Notice at the end of this Supplement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interest-Based Advertisements</h3>
                <p>Interest-Based Advertisements are designed to provide users with useful, interactive, and relevant advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.<br>In order to make the advertisements on your devices more relevant to you, we may (in accordance with applicable law) rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.<br>Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these categories of user groups for Interest-Based Advertisements. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and as a result, which advertisements your Smart TV and other connected devices receive.<br>Interest-Based Advertisements is an optional feature, and you may choose to enable or disable it at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.<br>Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information (e.g., IP address, and estimated TV size based on Model ID). Samsung processes this limited data – together with the Personalized Service ID (“PSID”) and Tizen ID for Advertising (“TIFA”) associated with your Smart TV – on the basis of its legitimate interest to serve generalized advertisements. These generalized advertisements might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.<br>For more detailed information about Interest-Based Advertisements, please refer to the Interest-Based Advertisements Privacy Notice at the end of this Supplement.</p>
                <h3>Voice Recognition</h3>
                <p>You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.<br>If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.<br>If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.<br>You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.</p>
                <p>For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the end of this Supplement.</p>
                <h3>Third Parties</h3>
                <p>Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third party websites and services you use.</p>
                <h3>Country-Specific Features</h3>
                <p>Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.</p>

                <p>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and its affiliated companies (collectively “Samsung”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we may collect and use to provide customized content your Smart TV.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Notice provides information about how Samsung collects, uses and shares your personal information in connection with Viewing Information Services. Our Privacy Policy at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a> (“Samsung Privacy Policy”) will also apply to your use of Viewing Information Services, and should be read in conjunction with this Privacy Notice.
                </p>
                <h3>WHAT ARE VIEWING INFORMATION SERVICES?</h3>
                <p>In order to provide you with customized content on your Smart TV, Samsung may rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information. Smart TV usage information includes information about frequently launched apps, and the start and end time for launching and using apps. Viewing Information Services is an optional service that you may choose to activate to receive content that is customized to your interests and entertainment preferences. If you choose not to activate this service, or to subsequently deactivate it, then you will receive generic content that is not customized to your specific interests or preferences and is based on your Smart TV usage information only.</p>
                <h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
                <p>We collect your TV viewing history, together with TV device identifiers (including Personalized Service ID or “PSID”) and IP address. Your TV viewing history includes information about:</p>
                <ul class="dot-list">
                  <li>the networks, channels, websites visited and programs viewed on your Smart TV; and</li>
                  <li>the amount of time spent viewing them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. We collect this information when your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information to our servers in order to determine the programs watched. When you consent to Viewing Information Services, then ACR will allow our Smart TVs to generate a unique video signature of TV frames in order to determine whether the video signature is from a TV program, Video-On-Demand titles, linear TV ads or video games. ACR does not identify content played through Samsung Smart TV apps.</p>
                <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p>We use the information described above to provide you customized content recommendations on your Smart TV, based on your interests and entertainment preferences.<br>Samsung processes personal information for Viewing Information Services on the basis of your consent, which you may provide by affirmatively ticking the checkbox associated with this Privacy Notice. You may subsequently withdraw your consent at any time by visiting the Settings menu (or by accessing the Privacy Choices app, if this is available on your Smart TV), in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be processed for that particular feature or purpose.</p>
                <h3>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?</h3>
                <p>We will share your personal information internally within our business, and with other Samsung Electronics Group companies which we control and/or own, for the purpose of providing Viewing Information Services.</p>
                <h3>WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA?</h3>
                <p>Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.</p>
                <p>[For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents Only]</p>
                <p>In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, and India. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA. To request more information or to obtain a copy of the contractual agreements in place, contact us. See the <a href="#contact-us">CONTACT US</a> section.</p>

                <p>Effective Date: 30th June, 2020</p>
                <p>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (‘Samsung’) and its affiliated companies respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we collect and use to display interest-based advertisements on your Smart TV and other connected devices.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which applies to your general use of the Samsung Smart TV and can be found at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a>.</p>
                <p>In this Privacy Notice, we describe the types of personal information used for interest-based advertisements, how we use that information, and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information and exercising your rights. Samsung is the data controller for the processing of personal information to display interest-based advertisements as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                <h3>WHAT ARE INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISEMENTS?</h3>
                <p>Interest-based advertisements are designed to provide users with useful, interactive, and relevant advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third-party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.</p>
                <p>In order to make the advertisements on your devices more relevant to you, we may—with your consent—analyze your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third-party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (“ACR”) and other technologies to capture and analyze your TV viewing history when you enable Viewing Information Services on your Samsung Smart TV. For more information on the Viewing Information Services feature, please select “Read More” in the where it appears beside the Viewing Information Services tick box.</p>
                <p>Based on the information above, we create groups of Samsung Smart TV users who share similar interests and use these categories of user groups for interest-based advertisements. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and as a result, which advertisements your Smart TV and other connected devices receive.</p>
                <p>Please note that some third parties may display interest-based advertisements in their apps on your Samsung Smart TV. These third parties are responsible for their own data practices, for example to have a valid legal basis to process your personal data. If you want to know how these third parties process your personal data, please review the privacy policies for their platforms and apps.
                </p>
                <p>To further protect your privacy, Samsung also provides you with additional options to exercise control over interest-based advertisements on third parties’ apps. For example, third parties are disallowed from processing your data to display interest-based advertisements in their apps unless they have both a valid legal basis for it on their own app and you have also opted in to interest-based advertisements on the Samsung Smart TV. If you would like to learn more about these options, please see the PSID AND TIFA and YOUR CHOICES sections below or visit <a href="www.samsungtifa.com" target="_blank">www.samsungtifa.com</a> for more information.</p>
                <h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
                <p>To provide you with interest-based advertisements, we may obtain the following information about your devices, which may include personal information:</p>
                <ul class="dot-list">
                  <li><u>Device Information</u>. We collect information such as your device model, operating system versions, device configurations and settings, IP address, and device identifiers (including the Personalized Service ID (“PSID”) and Tizen ID For Advertising (“TIFA”), which are unique, randomized, and user-resettable identifiers associated with your Smart TV, as described further below).</li>
                  <li><u>Device Usage and Log Information</u>. We collect information about how, when, and for how long you use your devices, including your interactions with interest-based advertisements and Samsung and third-party apps and services on the devices (such as a listing of apps on your devices).</li>
                  <li><u>TV Viewing Information</u>. We collect your TV viewing history. Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them. We may use ACR and other technologies to capture and analyze this TV viewing history when you enable the Viewing Information Services on your Samsung Smart TV (as described in the Viewing Information Services privacy notice).</li>
                  <li><u>Statistical Information</u>. We may use statistical information about you or your devices such as generalized location and estimated age group. We obtain this statistical information from commercially available sources (as permitted by law) such as our third-party service providers. We only work with third-party service providers who ensure that this information has been obtained in accordance with applicable law and can be provided to us for use and disclosure.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>PSID AND TIFA</h3>
                <p>Information about your device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing interest-based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the PSID. We will use the PSID for the display of advertisements to Samsung Smart TV users. You may reset your PSID as specified in the Your Choices section of this Privacy Notice.</p>
                <p>In order to protect your personal information and your preferences, third parties intending to provide advertisements in their apps will do so by collecting and using the TIFA associated with your Samsung Smart TV. The TIFA is a randomized version of your device's PSID, and this randomization ensures that such third parties do not know that it is your specific device to which advertisements are sent. Please visit <a href="www.samsungtifa.com" target="_blank">www.samsungtifa.com</a> if you would like to learn more about interest-based advertisements offered by third parties.</p>
                <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
                <ul class="dot-list">
                  <li>display (and allow advertisers to display) interest-based advertising on your Smart TV and other connected devices; and</li>
                  <li>improve and customize your experience with interest-based advertisements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Samsung processes personal information for interest-based advertisements on the basis of your consent, which you may provide by affirmatively selecting the tick box associated with this privacy notice. You may subsequently withdraw your consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Choices App or in the Settings on the Smart TV without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
                <h3>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?</h3>

                <p>We offer you certain choices in connection with your personal information collected and used by us and/or third parties for purposes of interest-based advertisements.</p>
                <p>You may reset your PSID and TIFA at any time by selecting “Reset PSID” on the settings menu, and once reset, your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information will not be linked to the its previous PSID (or TIFA). Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of interest-based advertisements will be affected.</p>
                <p>In addition, you may disable interest-based advertisements at any time by accessing the Privacy Choices app or the Settings menu on the Smart TV</p>
                <p>If you withdraw from interest-based advertisements, you will no longer receive interest-based advertisements provided by us and the third parties. Please note, however, that your privacy choice with respect to interest-based advertisements will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information (e.g., estimated TV size based on Model ID). They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests. Samsung processes this limited personal data to serve generalized advertisements on the Smart TV that are not based on users’ viewing behavior or other specific interests.</p>
